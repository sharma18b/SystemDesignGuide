# CDN Network - Scaling Considerations

## Geographic Expansion
- Add edge locations in new regions
- Deploy closer to users
- Reduce latency
- Improve user experience

## Capacity Scaling
- Add servers to existing edges
- Increase bandwidth
- Expand storage
- Handle traffic growth

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize cache hit rate
- Implement smart routing
- Use HTTP/3 and QUIC
- Enable compression
- Image optimization

## Cost Optimization
- Tiered pricing by region
- Optimize cache efficiency
- Reduce origin requests
- Bandwidth optimization

## DDoS Mitigation
- Massive distributed capacity
- Anycast routing
- Rate limiting
- Traffic filtering
- Automatic mitigation

## Monitoring
- Real-time metrics
- Cache hit rate
- Latency by region
- Error rates
- Traffic patterns

This scaling guide ensures the CDN can handle global growth while maintaining performance.
